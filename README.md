An "interative dictionary" for the Roblox game word bomb. It uses PyTesseract to grab the prompts from the screen and give a list of words with that prompt. **It is not 100% accurate**.

It is configured for a 1080p monitor playing Roblox in fullscreen. Re-configuring will take some editing of the code; it should be quite clear what to change.

You can click the word in the GUI to type out the word, however this is quite risky in an actual game because due to the nature of how it is coded (made to look realistic) it might take quite long to finish. I might turn the natural typing part into its own project so stay tuned.

This was simply a challenge for myself because I couldn't be bothered to download a script injector to create a proper cheat.

### I would not recommend using it, for a few reasons:
The game is great and cheating is scummy.

If you choose to be scummy, sadly there are much better alternatives out there.
